## Constantine Akritides
_Junior Software Engineer_

A recent Makers graduate and music practitioner. Creativity and problem solving are my two driving forces in software engineering. Creativity stems from my music background in classical piano and opera and problem solving stems from my STEM background together with analytical and logical reasoning. I am really passionate about bringing new ideas to life by developing and delivering products with social and commercial impact.

## Experience

**EnveLab** (Oct '18 - Jun '19)
<br>_Research Assistant / Data Analyst_

- Responsibility for the development and optimisation of/ a pharmakokinetic model based on independent studying of PBPK theory using laboratory-derived data to validate the model's behaviour
- Writing Python scripts to handle sensor-derived experimental data, transforming them so that they can be used in the computational models developed by the team
- Responsibility for drafting work package deliverables for EU research projects
- Gathered, arranged and corrected research data to create representative graphs and charts highlighting results for presentations.

<br>

**iGEM Greece 2017** (Oct '16 - Dec '17)
<br>_Undergraduate Researcher_
- Developing a Systems Biology model using Python and Matlab, that determined the temporal and spatial concentration values of an signalling molecule (AHL) during cellular communication via Quorum Sensing
- Constructing a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation model for examining the flow profile of chymus in the region of an Adenocarcinoma in the Ascending Colon, in order to be able to approximate the E.Coli K-12 bacterial distribution on the tumor
- Fundraising in order to cover the consumables, supplies and travel costs as well as the branding of the team and any general costs that might have occured; private companies and labs of the Thessaloniki region were recruited as sponsors and contributors after extensive communication, and public research funds were claimed as an additional boost to our project
- Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team from various scientific disciplines
- Organising meetings and public events for the team inside and outside the university for enhancing the team's outreach

<br>

**Self-Employed**
<br>_University-level Tutor (Quantum Mechanics & Statistical Physics)_ (Sep '15 - Sep '18)

- Planning sessions by revisiting the concept under question, and extracting the most abstract points in it that are then used to build a conceptual model of the phenomenon so that it can be conveyed to the student more effectively
- Simplifying complex concepts into digestible chunks of information and delivering them to student in the form of discussion and problem-solving-oriented sessions (through exercises and examples)
- Consolidating knowledge, improving communication and weak spots in the subject area of interest, and self-reflecting by implementing the Feynman Technique

<br>_High School Physics and Maths Tutor_ (Sep '15 - Sep '16)

- Responsibility for creating, preparing and delivering study material for the student (e.g. worksheets, exercises, consolidation questions, theory cheatsheets) based on the student's personal needs and goals
- Preparing students for the National Panhellenic Exams (A levels equivalent in Greece) in Physics and Maths
- Dedicating time during each lesson to discuss with each student their progress, self-development, worries/concerns
- Teaching each student how to learn independently by using an active approach in learning rather than a passive one of digesting information
- Teaching effective and quick problem-solving by showing students how to solve physics and math problems by visualising the problem and then by finding patterns in it that give away the solution or the best next step
- Responsibility for the student's academic wellbeing and progress
- Self-learning and development from direct or indirect feedback received from students and their their progress

## Skills

**Problem Solving**

I am actively coordinating my problem-solving process using the Feynman Technique, and in deadlock scenarios I tend to coordinate my problem solving process based on the Bransford and Stein's IDEAL model. Planning both BSc and MSc Theses in an attempt to tackle novel ideas with limited support from literature, required an innate ability to identify the main idea behind the project, define the obstacles presented during planning, and decide how to proceed further by re-tuning decisions based on feedback after each course of action. During the group projects at Makers, I applied my skills by clearly defining the problem of each project and by breaking it down into smaller compartments, after having understood the requirements from an abstract perspective. Thinking of data flow while designing and then, developing an application enables me to visualise the problem and conceptualise data patterns.

**Teamwork**

In a team environment, I find the idea of leading the team quite motivating and refreshing. I am competent in bringing innovative ideas to the table and being able to share them with my team, as well as actually implementing those ideas by getting my hands dirty. Keeping a healthy and supportive team environment, by listening to everyone's concerns/arguments and/or ideas, is also a priority as it enables everyone to feel comfortable and listened to and thus, communicate effectively and boost the team's productivity n-fold. The proofs of all aforementioned statements are the successful group projects while at Makers and the success of iGEM Greece 2017, being a multidisciplinary team that started with 0 resources and managed to win a gold medal in the iGEM Competition.

**Leadership**

I am willing to inspire others with my ideas and goals and guide them towards achieving those in a cooperative and inspirational environment. Being a good leader is determined by the success of my team and the relationships built within it between its members and by the commitment the leader inspires. My innate source of motivation, enthusiasm and determination is a driving force for teams and individuals, which during stagnation or troubleshooting and crisis-handling within a team, can be the decisive factor in the team's success.

**Empathy**

As I have then need to feel listened to and to be understood by others, equally so I tend to empathise with people around me and I am trying to understand how they're feeling and relate to them as that brings us closer. Coming from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences (STEM, music, teaching), I have encountered multiple types of personalities and hidden gems in people in such a way that it made me more sympathetic and able to spot "the fine print" of each person a lot easier. I enjoy the process of getting to know new people and personalities.

**Creativity**

Music has been the protagonist in my artistic and cultural upbringing and nurturing in such a way that it feels as if it provided me with an extra pair of eyes that enables me to look at things from a more holistic perspective and with open-mindedness. Every new problem for me is like a new puzzle or riddle I need to solve not by following templates necessarily, but rather, by finding patterns in the problem that could potentially lead to its solution. For instance, in software engineering, this has enabled me to achieve a much more elegant and efficient OOD, smooth data flow in-between components and services, and dividing a problem into smaller entities with clear responsibilities.

**Strategic Adaptability**

In previous professional environments (iGEM, EnveLab) as well as in group projects, always feeling listened-to or being able to effectively communicate with everyone and being able to convince people proved impossible. For instance, I once tried to convey the message to my team that I wanted to work on a specific user story and feature of the application (authentication), but noticed that other 2 members wanted to claim the same feature. I had to decide on whether I would keep on arguing about the feature or choose a different one to work on. The answer was clear, wasting time in arguing about choosing a feature instead of implementing it was pointless. Thus, I decided to work on another feature (posts) in which my sufficient-for-the-project knowledge of SQL would accelerate the process even further. That way, I strategically adapted to a situation where the decision would eventually determine the smooth development of the application.
