## Experience

**EnveLab** (Oct '18 - Jun '19)
<br>_Research Assistant / Data Analyst_

- Responsibility for the development and optimisation of/ a pharmakokinetic model based on independent studying of PBPK theory using laboratory-derived data to validate the model's behaviour
- Writing Python scripts to handle sensor-derived experimental data, transforming them so that they can be used in the computational models developed by the team
- Responsibility for drafting work package deliverables for EU research projects

<br>

**iGEM Greece 2017** (Oct '16 - Dec '17)
<br>_Undergraduate Researcher_
- Developing a Systems Biology model using Python and Matlab, that determined the temporal and spatial concentration values of an signalling molecule (AHL) during cellular communication via Quorum Sensing
- Constructing a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation model for examining the flow profile of chymus in the region of an Adenocarcinoma in the Ascending Colon, in order to be able to approximate the E.Coli K-12 bacterial distribution on the tumor
- Fundraising in order to cover the consumables, supplies and travel costs as well as the branding of the team and any general costs that might have occured; private companies and labs of the Thessaloniki region were recruited as sponsors and contributors after extensive communication, and public research funds were claimed as an additional boost to our project
- Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team from various scientific disciplines
- Organising meetings and public events for the team inside and outside the university for enhancing the team's outreach

<br>

**Self-Employed**
<br>_University-level Tutor (Quantum Mechanics & Statistical Physics)_ (Sep '15 - Sep '18)

- Planning sessions by revisiting the concept under question, and extracting the most abstract points in it that are then used to build a conceptual model of the phenomenon so that it can be conveyed to the student more effectively
- Simplifying complex concepts into digestible chunks of information and delivering them to student in the form of discussion and problem-solving-oriented sessions (through exercises and examples)
- Consolidating knowledge, improving communication and weak spots in the subject area of interest, and self-reflecting by implementing the Feynman Technique

<br>_High School Physics and Maths Tutor_ (Sep '15 - Sep '16)

- Responsibility for creating, preparing and delivering study material for the student (e.g. worksheets, exercises, consolidation questions, theory cheatsheets) based on the student's personal needs and goals
- Preparing students for the National Panhellenic Exams (A levels equivalent in Greece) in Physics and Maths
- Dedicating time during each lesson to discuss with each student their progress, self-development, worries/concerns
- Teaching each student how to learn independently by using an active approach in learning rather than a passive one of digesting information
- Teaching effective and quick problem-solving by showing students how to solve physics and math problems by visualising the problem and then by finding patterns in it that give away the solution or the best next step
- Responsibility for the student's academic wellbeing and progress
- Self-learning and development from direct or indirect feedback received from students and their their progress

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
